The heart of the monument
The Taj Mahal mausoleum is a work of Mughal architecture, crafted in white marble. In the center of the building are the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan, testifying to their shared history. The quality of the materials used, particurlarly the stone worked using the pietra dura technique, reflects the artisanal excellence of the period.

The spacial organization
The entire site is designed according to the symmetrical principles typical of the Mughal Empire. The monument's layout integrates the various elements - minarets, domes, and circulation spaces - to naturally guide the visit. The result is a harmonious distribution that allows visitors to understand the structure while discovering the architectural subtleties, such as the details created in multiani mitti during restoration work.

The contemplation areas
The interior and exterior spaces have been designed to offer a variety of ambiences. Inside, the masterful use of marble and pietra dura inlays creates zones of light and shadow that reveal the cenotaphs and other reliefs. Outside, the monument's surroudings are organized in a manner typical of Mughal architecture, reinforced by the regular presence of minarets that structure the landscape.

Harmonized materials
Each material used contributes to the uniqueness of the Taj Mahal. Marble, chosen for its purity and ability to reflect light, blends perfectly with the finishes provided by pietra dura. In addition, the use of multiani mitti in some restoration work reflects a concern to preserve the authenticity and durability of the original materials, thus repecting the craft heritage of the MÃ©ughal Empire.
