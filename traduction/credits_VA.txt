The goal of this project
This website was produced as part of a university project in partnership with UNESCO. It is part of an exercise to put us in a Professional situation, aimed at developing our skills in project management, digital communication, accesibility and cultural mediation. Our aim is to offer a clear, accessible and enriching platform for all audiences - travelers, the curious researchers or simple history buffs - wishing to discover the Taj Mahal in a different way, whether before, during or after their visit.
